The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of status. It has become such common Christmas list item for broke young teenagers that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="https://www.businesstoday.in/visualstories/technology/who-is-bernard-arnault-meet-worlds-richest-person-alive-who-once-again-beat-elon-musk-24896-03-03-2023">richest man on the planet</a>

Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service to others) is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive culture than we can imagine.

                                        Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could be used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves and others.

One where we collectively take accountability for the capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species. Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new alignment would have.

                                        “Over the past hundred years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold, yet wealth inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows rapidly. In order to change the failure of redistribution of wealth at scale, we must effectively influence culture and help redefine what “status” is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of money in society as the new age of status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a society which healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective project we are responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not supporting doing good as the highest form of status.  We have more than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.” - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="https://JackJay.io">Jack Jay</a>

Status is a form of positive competitive drive in society and a tool for respect attribution. That’s why you see Dior shoes in economy.

Thus this expenditure is not a failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in Bangladesh (<em>a small home can be built as a permanent structure for someone for this amount</em>
                                        ).  We need higher forms of status to exist in order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic level.

With no better alternative currently, we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we are, <b>the clothing we wear</b>

That’s what designer clothing represents today. Useless expense for materials with patterns that represent pure vanity. Pure spending power gone to pure status.

In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style goods declining while a push for understated looks are coming forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more oversaturated, and pieces that lack design besides the plastery of the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.

Imagine an individual who is struggling to provide for themselves, eventually however, they begin to thrive. They start a business and after having major success exit for a few million dollars. What is the standard look and lifestyle of this person after this event?</div>

This is the part of the brain which feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social hierarchy. And this is not something I believe we can change, people WILL naturally compete to go up the chain of the social hierarchy, people want to outdo each other, people are competitive, people are different and respect should be given where it is due. </div>

We have been sold a narrative by the luxury and designer corporations, who have massive budgets to win the celebrities over, that designer and luxury clothing IS high status. Those who spend $4k on a designer bag versus one of equivalent quality for $50 are put higher on the status scale. If we can collectively redefine this status symbol as tacky, which has already been changing for in-your-face luxury design brand styles, we will change where the money which pays for status goes.</div>

People still want to buy a high end item, so instead, a brand which offers that price of bag, that level of quality, whose surplus funds goes towards making that positive change is perfect.</div>
